    "All features are statistically significant at the .001 level. Overallqual's coefficient is the largest, meaning it has the strongest effect on saleprice, followed, by garagecars, then grlivarea, totalbsmtsf, and finally firstflrsf. The results seem somewhat reasonable, as overallqual must be an aggregate variable already closely related to how a realtor perceives value in a home, and garagecars may be a strong predictor for home size: very few homes would have a three car garage and be cramped for space and quality. It seems wrong at first glance that basement square footage would have nearly twice the effect on saleprice than first floor square footage. "
